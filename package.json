  "description": "This action wraps the Slack [chat.postMessage](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage) API method for posting to channels, private groups, and DMs. This action sends messages using [Slack bot tokens](https://api.slack.com/docs/token-types), which have two main advantages compared to user tokens and incoming webhooks: (1) Bots can't be disabled inadvertently when a Slack user is disabled or removed. Slack has written about this in a [recent announcement](https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/the-latest-with-app-tokens-fe878d44130c), and (2) Bots offer a [powerful range of capabilities](https://api.slack.com/bot-users) that can be leveraged to perform more functions.",
